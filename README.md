# ghc-profiler tool

ghc-profiler is a GHC profiling and performance tuning program.

- its main purpose is to optimize GHC itself to reduce build times and
memory consumption, which are some of the main complaints about GHC.
- its second purpose is to be used to benchmark and to analyze programs
  generated by GHC.

The idea is to automate profiling processes as much as possible and to allow for
interactive exploration of the profiling data.

## Why a new tool?

There are too many scattered scripts and programs to deal with some aspects of
GHCâ€™s performance. In addition many steps are still to be performed manually
(e.g. building GHC with some specific flags).

We want to have a consistent and maintainable tool: hence written in Haskell and
without too many dependencies on other tools/libraries. We want a consistent UI
which provides a pleasant UX.
